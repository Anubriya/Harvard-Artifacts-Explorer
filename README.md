# Harvard-Artifacts-Explorer
This is a data-driven application built using Python, Streamlit, SQLite, and the Harvard Art Museums API. The goal of the project is to fetch, store, and explore artifact data from the Harvard Art Museums. Users can interactively choose artifact classifications, fetch objects, save the data in a database, run SQL queries to analyze the collection.
